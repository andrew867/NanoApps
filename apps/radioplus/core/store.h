/*
 * store.h — what Radio+ writes down: presets, and the RDS sidecar for a
 * recording.
 *
 * JSON, because these are files a person may well want to read, edit or copy
 * between devices, and because a recording outlives the app that made it. A
 * sidecar full of packed binary would be useless in five years; a sidecar full
 * of JSON is still readable with nothing but a text editor.
 *
 * The writer here is deliberately small - object, array, key, value, escape -
 * rather than a general JSON library. It emits into a caller-supplied buffer
 * and never allocates, so the same code serves the Linux build writing through
 * stdio and the RetailOS one writing through hb_fs_stream_write.
 *
 * The reader is equally small and only understands the shapes this file writes.
 * That is a deliberate limit and not a hidden one: en_preset_load() is
 * documented to be forgiving about whitespace and ordering and nothing else.
 *
 * The sidecar records raw groups alongside decoded fields. Raw groups mean a
 * recording can be decoded again later, by a better decoder than the one that
 * made it - which matters here specifically, because the FIFO framing in
 * core/rds.c is not yet confirmed and every recording made before it is
 * confirmed would otherwise be undecodable afterwards.
