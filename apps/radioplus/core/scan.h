/*
 * scan.h — sweep the band and turn what is on it into presets.
 *
 * Filling the preset list by hand means tuning to a station, deciding it is
 * worth keeping, saving it, and doing that twenty times. The tuner can do it.
 *
 * Two passes, deliberately.
 *
 *   The SWEEP asks only "is anything here". Where the chip can seek for
 *   itself it is asked to, and it jumps straight from one station to the next
 *   without this code ever naming the empty channels between them. Where it
 *   cannot, every channel is stepped and measured in software - a hundred
 *   milliseconds each, so a European band at 100 kHz spacing is 205 channels
 *   and twenty seconds.
 *
 *   The NAMING pass goes back to what the sweep found and sits on each one
 *   long enough for RDS to arrive. That is seconds, not milliseconds - the
 *   station name comes in group 0A, two characters at a time, and a weak
 *   signal can take several seconds to spell eight letters. Doing it on every
 *   channel would take eight minutes; doing it on the twenty that have
 *   something on them takes one.
 *
 * The chip can do more than seek: it has a preset-scan mode that would return
 * the whole station list in one go (I2C_FM_SEARCH_METHOD = Preset, then
 * I2C_FM_PRESET_MAX_CHANNEL and I2C_FM_PRESET_CHANNEL). That is not used here
 * and the reason is in fmreg.c: those three registers are marked EN_FM_TBD,
 * and the value of I2C_FM_SEARCH_TUNE_MODE that starts a preset search is not
 * one of the ones the bring-up sequence pinned down. Guessing at a mode
 * register on a chip nobody has been able to test against yet is how you get
 * a scan that appears to work and returns furniture. When the driver is up and
 * the mode value is known from something other than inference, this is the
 * file that changes, and only the sweep half of it.
 *
 * The whole thing is a state machine over an externally supplied clock with no
 * knowledge of any tuner. It says what it wants done and is told what it got.
 * That is what lets it run identically on the device and in the host preview,
 * and be tested with neither.
