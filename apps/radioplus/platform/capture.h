/*
 * capture.h — FM audio capture, the live buffer, and recording.
 *
 * On this hardware the tuner's digital audio arrives on a separate I2S
 * controller from the one driving the headphones, which is what makes recording
 * while listening possible at all rather than a trick: capture and playback are
 * different devices and neither has to yield to the other. RetailOS does the
 * same thing for its Live Pause, and the captured DMA state shows both channels
 * armed in every state including playing-from-buffer.
 *
 * Two consumers hang off one capture:
 *
 *   The live buffer is a ring in memory that is always filling while the tuner
 *   is on. It is what makes it possible to jump back to something that has
 *   already been said, and it costs nothing when unused.
 *
 *   A recording is a WAV file written as it arrives. Starting one does not
 *   disturb the live buffer, and a recording can begin with the contents of
 *   the live buffer, so "record this" can reach backwards to before the button
 *   was pressed - which is the only useful moment to press it.
 *
 * The capture runs on its own thread. Nothing here blocks the UI.
