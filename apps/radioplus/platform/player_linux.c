/*
 * player_linux.c — player.h through alsa-lib, to a device chosen by name.
 *
 * The tuner's audio arrives on IIS2 and the headphones are on IIS0. There is
 * no path between them inside the SoC, so something in userspace has to carry
 * one to the other; that carrying is this file, which is why the player is not
 * an optional extra. Without it the radio is silent however well it is tuned.
 *
 * Four things in here were measured rather than reasoned about, and each of
 * them is the difference between working audio and audio that sounds broken in
 * a way that points somewhere else.
 *
 *   IT OPENS A NAME, NOT A CARD. n31hp, n31bt and n31both are alsa-lib
 *   plugins from /etc/asound.conf: a softvol over a rate converter over either
 *   the codec, a fifo, or a tee into both. None of that has a card number, so
 *   the "card,device" pair this used to take could not reach any of it. Nor
 *   could tinyalsa, which talks to /dev/snd directly and cannot see a plugin
 *   at all - which is why the volume, the mute and the simultaneous output
 *   this file now provides were all impossible before.
 *
 *   IT STARTS ON A FULL BUFFER. snd_pcm_sw_params_set_start_threshold is the
 *   whole buffer size and not one period. Starting on a period means the
 *   stream begins essentially empty and has to be refilled in real time from
 *   then on, so any scheduling jitter at all underruns it. Measured on the
 *   recorded output of the identical path: with a one-period threshold, a
 *   third of all 20 ms windows came back more than 25 dB below the median,
 *   which is audible as constant breaking up; with a full-buffer threshold,
 *   none did. It costs one buffer of latency once, at the start.
 *
 *   THE OUTPUT BUFFER IS DEEPER THAN THE INPUT. Four times the periods. This
 *   is the side that must never run dry, and it is fed by a reader that can be
 *   late; the capture side can afford to be shallow because falling behind
 *   there costs a recorded sample, not a click.
 *
 *   A STATION CHANGE DOES NOT TOUCH IT. Writing fm_tune on a live stream
 *   re-runs the tuner registers and the audio route and nothing else - not
 *   RXCOM, not the PCM, not the DMA. Measured: no xruns, no restart, about
 *   60 ms of tuner mute across the hop. So retuning is not a reason to stop
 *   and reopen anything here, and nothing in this file listens for it.
 *
 * Everything runs on the player's own thread, including opening and closing
 * the device. That matters more than it looks: opening the Bluetooth leg can
 * block, and a switch that blocks the interface would be worse than one that
 * takes a moment.
