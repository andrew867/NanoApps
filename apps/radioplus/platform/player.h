/*
 * player.h — what comes out of the headphones.
 *
 * One player, two sources, because they are the same job. Tuner audio arrives
 * on IIS2 and the headphones are on IIS0, so something has to carry it across -
 * the n31-fm helper does it with arecord piped into aplay. That carrying is the
 * player, which is why it is not an optional extra: without it the radio is
 * silent even when perfectly tuned.
 *
 * Once the live audio is going through a player rather than straight out, three
 * things fall out for nothing:
 *
 *   Live is a position, not a mode. Playing the newest frame in the ring is
 *   live; playing an older one is being behind. There is no separate path.
 *
 *   Scrubbing back is moving that position, and catching up is moving it to the
 *   end - which is exactly what the LIVE button does.
 *
 *   A recording is the same player reading a file instead of the ring.
 *
 * The whole thing runs on its own thread and never blocks the UI.
