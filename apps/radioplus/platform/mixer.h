/*
 * mixer.h — the card's controls, by name.
 *
 * Level on this device is not one control, it is five, and which one matters
 * depends on where the audio is going. That is a consequence of how the audio
 * graph is built rather than an accident:
 *
 *   The CS42L81 has a real analog playback volume, so the headphone leg has
 *   one register that genuinely attenuates.
 *
 *   Nothing else does. The tuner has no volume anywhere in the recovered
 *   FM_RDS_Command map, and the Bluetooth leg is an SBC encoder in userspace
 *   with no gain stage at all. /etc/asound.conf supplies both with softvol,
 *   which applies the gain in the plugin and registers a genuine mixer control
 *   for it - so "Bluetooth Soft Volume" is a control on card 0 that behaves
 *   like any other, without a register existing anywhere behind it.
 *
 * So there is one softvol per output, and the one to move is the one belonging
 * to the device currently open. The codec's own volume sits underneath the
 * headphone leg and is a calibration rather than a knob: it is what decides
 * whether the output clips, and it is set once at start-up.
 *
 * Everything is looked up BY NAME. The numeric index of a control shifts as
 * controls are added to the machine driver or as softvol registers another
 * one, so an index cached at start-up is a control that silently becomes a
 * different control later.
 *
 * A control that is not there is not an error. softvol registers its control
 * when its PCM is first opened, so on a machine where nothing has opened
 * n31bt yet, "Bluetooth Soft Volume" genuinely does not exist - and it will,
 * later, without anything restarting. Callers ask again rather than latching
 * the first answer.
