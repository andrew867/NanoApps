/*
 * tuner_linux.c — tuner.h through the bcm2078-bt driver.
 *
 * The driver owns hci0 and sends FM_RDS_Command (vendor opcode 0xFC15) itself.
 * Everything here goes through its sysfs interface and nothing touches the UART
 * or builds an HCI packet, which is the driver's job. If the tuner needs
 * something this file cannot express, the answer is a driver patch, not a
 * shortcut around it.
 *
 * Attributes, from bcm2078-bt.c:
 *
 *   fm_power   W   "1" / "0"
 *   fm_tune    W   kHz, decimal
 *   fm_seek    W   "up" / "down"
 *   fm_rssi    R   "%u"
 *   fm_snr     R   "%u"
 *   fm_rds     RW  write "1"/"0"; read gives on=, poll=, groups=, flag=,
 *                  pi=, pty=, ps=, rt=
 *   fm_reg     RW  write "r <reg> <len>" or "w <reg> <hex>"; read gives
 *                  "0x%02x: %*ph"
 *   hci_cmd    RW  arbitrary command, not used here
 *
 * Mute is the exception that does not appear in that list, because it is not in
 * sysfs at all: bcm2078-bt exports it and the nano7-audio machine driver
 * publishes it as the "FM Tuner Mute" control on card 0. That is the proper
 * interface for it - a mixer control is how everything else on this card is
 * turned down - so this file reaches it through tinyalsa's mixer rather than
 * asking for a sysfs attribute that deliberately does not exist.
 *
 * Note what fm_reg buys beyond convenience: register 0x80 is the RDS FIFO, so
 * reading it gives raw tuples that this app can decode itself with core/rds.c
 * rather than settling for the driver's summary. The driver's own pi, ps and rt
 * are then an independent oracle for that decoder - and in particular for the
 * one unverified thing in it, the FIFO tuple framing. Both are read, and a
 * disagreement is worth surfacing rather than hiding.

/* ---- bringing the controller up ------------------------------------------ */

/*
 * FM rides on hci0, and the driver answers ENETDOWN while it is down. The
 * device rootfs has no hciconfig, btmgmt or rfkill to bring it up with, so the
 * app does it directly - this is precisely what hciconfig hci0 up performs.
 *
 * Doing it here rather than in a launcher means the radio works when started by
 * hand, from a menu, or on boot, instead of only through one script.
 *
 * Two operations, and the difference between them is the whole of this file's
 * startup behaviour.
 *
 *   ASKING is an ioctl that returns immediately. HCIGETDEVINFO hands back the
 *   controller's flags and HCI_UP is bit zero of them.
 *
 *   RAISING is not. hci_bcm now carries HCI_QUIRK_NON_PERSISTENT_SETUP - it
 *   has to, or a controller left DOWN keeps a serdev open with its receiver
 *   enabled and buries the machine in interrupts - and the quirk means the
 *   kernel re-runs hdev->setup() on every open. That is a 31 KB patchram
 *   upload and a baud change, held under the device's request lock. HCIDEVUP
 *   blocks for seconds.
 *
 * These used to be one call, which is why this app reported "no Bluetooth"
 * while the boot script was still bringing the controller up: one attempt, at
 * the wrong instant, and the answer latched. Now the asking is cheap enough to
 * do several times a second and the raising happens on a thread of its own, so
 * the interface keeps drawing while the radio comes up underneath it.
