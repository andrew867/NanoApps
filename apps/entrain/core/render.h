/*
 * render.h — turn a parameter ramp into interleaved 16-bit stereo PCM.
 *
 * The renderer holds its oscillator phases across calls. That is the whole
 * reason it is a struct and not a function: a program is a chain of segments,
 * and if segment N+1 restarted its phase at zero, every join would click. Call
 * en_render_segment() repeatedly on one en_render_t and the joins are
 * continuous by construction.
 *
 * Parameters ramp linearly from `start` to `end` across the segment, updated
 * once per 64-sample control block — 5.8 ms at 11025 Hz, far finer than the
 * 50-200 ms glide the UI asks for and far coarser than recomputing a phase step
 * per sample.
 *
 * A segment may carry up to EN_MAX_LAYERS carrier pairs sounding together,
 * each with its own mode, beat and gain, over one shared noise bed. See the
 * layer block below. Every phase in every layer is held across calls for the
 * same reason the single-layer phases always were.

/* ---- layers -------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A layer is one carrier pair with its own mode, beat and gain. Most of what
 * this app plays is a single layer, but a long practice program is typically
 * two or three sounding at once: a main training carrier, a quiet warm one
 * below it, and a quieter support above. They are separate layers rather than
 * separate segments because they overlap in time and each has its own beat.
 *
 * `level` is an ABSOLUTE peak amplitude, not a share of a normalised mix.
 * Layers sum, and it is the caller's job to keep the sum sane — the source
 * material this exists to render specifies peak amplitudes directly (0.045,
 * 0.070, 0.018 and so on, summing well under one). Normalising here would
 * silently rescale a mix whose balance is the whole point of it. The soft
 * clipper remains as a backstop and nothing more.
 *
 * `start.tone_level` stays the master gain over the summed layers, so a
 * single-layer segment at unity layer gain is bit-for-bit what it always was,
 * and a multi-layer one is still subject to the same headroom discipline.
