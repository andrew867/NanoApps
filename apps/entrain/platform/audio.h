/*
 * audio.h — the whole platform audio interface, and deliberately tiny.
 *
 * The device and the desktop reach audio in completely different ways: the
 * iPod can only be handed a file to play (see AUDIO_NOTES.md — there is no
 * streaming path, and loads are capped at 1 MiB), while a Linux host streams
 * PCM to ALSA. The shared UI must not care which it is talking to, so the
 * interface is expressed in the one operation both can do:
 *
 *     "here is a seamless loop; play it until I say otherwise."
 *
 * Everything the device backend has to do — write a WAV, watch the heap, load
 * it, re-arm before the loop ends — lives behind en_audio_submit and
 * en_audio_tick. Everything the host backend has to do lives there too.

   A steady preset is one buffer submitted with loop=true, and nothing else
   ever happens. A program is a chain of chunks — each one a ramp, so none of
   them can loop — submitted with loop=false and queued one ahead. Two slots is
   the least that expresses both, and it maps onto what the device can do: the
   expensive step there is loading a file, so the next chunk is loaded into a
   second descriptor while the current one plays, leaving only the cheap play
   call to happen at the join.

   `key` identifies the buffer for caching — the device backend keys its
   on-disk WAV cache by it, so replaying a preset is instant. The PCM is
   16-bit stereo interleaved and is copied or written out before the call
   returns; the caller may free it afterwards.
