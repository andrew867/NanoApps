/*
 * audio_device.c — audio.h on the iPod under RetailOS.
 *
 * Generates audio a block at a time straight into RAM, and hands the blocks to
 * the OS as a CHAIN, so the sound hardware runs them together and there is no
 * join left for us to get wrong.
 *
 * The chain is the whole design, and it comes from RetailOS 1.1.2 itself. When
 * a voice finishes a buffer, its completion handler does this before any
 * teardown:
 *
 *     8631580: ldr r0, [r4, #0x78]   ; r0 = voice->descriptor
 *     8631584: ldr r1, [r0, #0x54]   ; r1 = descriptor+0x54
 *     8631588: cmp r1, #0
 *     863158c: beq <tear down>
 *     8631590: mov r0, r4
 *     8631594: bl  0x862fd24         ; voice::setSource(voice, next)
 *     863159c: bl  0x8630154         ; voice::start(voice)
 *
 * descriptor+0x54 is a NEXT pointer. A voice reaching the end of one buffer
 * re-arms itself from it immediately, inside its own completion handler, on the
 * audio task. That is a sample-exact join: not a short gap, not a small step —
 * the same continuous stream, concatenated by the hardware.
 *
 * Everything else follows from that:
 *
 *   - voice::setSource (VA 0x0862fd24) writes descriptor+0x64 = 1 when a voice
 *     takes a descriptor up, and the completion handler writes it back to 0. So
 *     each block carries its own "finished" flag, and which buffers are free to
 *     render into stops being a timing estimate and becomes a fact.
 *
 *   - setSource also applies rate, channels, bit depth and volume from the
 *     descriptor (VAs 0x8631610, 0x86306c8, 0x8630440, 0x86304a4), so a chained
 *     descriptor is set up as completely as one passed to play(). play() is
 *     only needed to get the first voice going.
 *
 *   - The UI tick no longer has to be punctual, only to keep up. It renders
 *     ahead and links blocks onto the tail; the join itself is the audio task's
 *     business. Nothing here spins on the clock any more.
 *
 * The two versions before this one tried to hide the join with a crossfade, and
 * both sounded wrong. Overlapping consecutive buffers does not blend two
 * sounds: consecutive buffers are consecutive samples of ONE signal, so an
 * overlap sums that signal with a time-shifted copy of itself, which is a comb
 * filter whose notches sweep as the timing drifts. The host tests measure it —
 * half a carrier period of misalignment, 2.5 ms, cancels the carrier outright.
 * No crossfade length fixes that, because the crossfade IS the defect.
 *
 * One field has to be right for any of this to work, and it is not obvious.
 * descriptor+0x34 feeds the voice's counter at voice+0x48:
 *
 *     862fd54: ldr r0, [r4, #0x34]    ; descriptor+0x34
 *     862fd58: ldr r6, [r5, #0x0C]    ; the voice's rate
 *     862fd5c: mul r0, r0, r6
 *     862fd60: bl  0x842d93c          ; / 1000
 *     862fd64: str r0, [r5, #0x48]
 *
 * The constructor leaves it zero and voice::start never touches it, so the
 * counter was zero. The exhaustion path then computes the shortfall to carry
 * into the next buffer as `samples_wanted - 0` — the whole mixer pass rather
 * than the true remainder — and the mixer re-enters at 0x86312e0 with that as
 * its target, emitting a pass worth of samples too many at every transition. A
 * few milliseconds out, once per block: a faint click.
 *
 * The counter has to hold the block's frame count. Getting there needs one more
 * fact, and assuming it wrongly is worth a block of silence: voice+0x0C is the
 * mixer's OUTPUT rate, not the descriptor's. VA 0x8631610 gives it away, since
 * it compares voice+0x0C against descriptor+0x14 to decide whether any
 * resampling is needed at all. So a block stated in its own milliseconds
 * converts to twice its length on a 44100 mixer, and the voice counts on for a
 * whole block after the PCM has run out — which is audible as exactly that: a
 * block of sound, a block of silence.
 *
 * So the duration is computed backwards from the sample count instead,
 * ms = frames * 1000 / output_rate, against the rate read off the live voice.
 * The value is only used when it converts back to exactly the frame count;
 * anything else falls back to zero, which is the behaviour that played
 * correctly all along, just with the mis-accounting above. Block lengths are
 * stated in frames and chosen to divide cleanly at any plausible mixer rate.
 *
 * Pause and stop do not wait for a block boundary. The voice reads our buffer
 * live, which is what makes the completion flag meaningful, and it cuts both
 * ways: they write a short fade to zero into the part of the sounding block the
 * voice has not reached yet, and silence the rest. A silent block is then
 * chained to ITSELF, so the voice loops silence for nothing while paused, the
 * DAC stays up, and resuming is a matter of pointing that block's next at real
 * audio again.
 *
 * Ownership: buffers come from hb_os_alloc and are never handed to loadFile, so
 * the OS never frees them. Descriptors live in this file for the life of the
 * app and are rebuilt before each handover, and the constructor zeroes the
 * buffer pointers without freeing, so there is no path to a double free.
